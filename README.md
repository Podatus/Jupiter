_Datavisualization of the state of all the modules used in the computer music work_ Jupiter

# Jupiter

*Jupiter* is a master piece of computer music, for flute and live electronics, composed during 1986-7 by Philippe Manoury and Miller Puckette, at Ircam (Paris) [1]. The code of the electronic production is available via a project called *Pure Data Repository Project*, thanks to Miller Puckette, downloadable here [msp.ucsd.edu/pdrp/latest/](http://msp.ucsd.edu/pdrp/latest/)

This repository includes six programs I have made during my PhD [2] for analyzing *Jupiter*. The goal of them is to represent the routing of the electronic production, *i.e.* all the connections between the modules which take place during the half an hour of this musical work (like reverb to frequency shifter, flute to harmonizer etc.).
